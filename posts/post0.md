This is a template for my blog posts.

An introductory paragraph for your blog post. This is a great place to give readers a quick overview of the topic.

## Section 1: Enhanced Formatting
Use different formatting options to highlight important text:
- **Bold text** for emphasis
- *Italic text* for subtle emphasis
- ~~Strikethrough~~ for outdated or corrected information
- > Blockquote for quotes or highlighted information

## Section 2: Lists and Checklists
1. Ordered lists help outline steps or sequence:
   - Sub-items can add more detail
2. Use them for step-by-step guides or rankings

- Unordered lists work well for general points:
   - Add as many bullet points as needed

- [x] Checklists are useful for task tracking
- [ ] Like this one for to-do items

## Section 3: Adding Links and Tables
Include [hyperlinks](https://example.com) to reference additional resources or sources.

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| Row 1    | Data     | More Data|
| Row 2    | Data     | More Data|

## Section 4: Image and Video Embeds
Images can break up text and add visual interest:

You can also include embedded videos from platforms like YouTube by pasting the link:

## Section 5: Horizontal Rules and Escape Characters
Use horizontal rules to divide sections:

---

If you need to show literal symbols, escape them with backslashes: \*, \#, \_

## Section 6: Custom HTML and Emojis
You can even include custom HTML if you need more control:

<div style="background-color: #f9f9f9; padding: 10px; border-radius: 5px;">
  Custom styled box using HTML.
</div>

## Section 7: Code
```python
print('hello world')
```

Or add emojis for a bit of personality ðŸŽ‰ðŸš€
